  TODO:
  - change <td>s to clickable, cycle between white/green/yellow/red
  - establish relationships between Users and Timeslots
  - change <tr>s into Timeslot components, ordered chronologically by date/time
  - allow users to add new timeslots
  - clicking each <td> initiates Ajax call and saves it in db
  - when a column is fully green, send out confirmation email
